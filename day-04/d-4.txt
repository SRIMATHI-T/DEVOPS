Jenkins 
What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
It automatically:
•	Builds code
•	Tests code
•	Deploys applications
Whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.
Why Jenkins is Used
•	Automates manual work
•	Saves time
•	Reduces human errors
•	Ensures code is always tested and ready
How Jenkins is Used in Your Project (Git + Docker Example)
You are using:
•	Ubuntu
•	GitHub
•	Node.js app
•	Docker
Here’s how Jenkins fits:
Step-by-Step Flow
1️ Developer pushes code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Updated app"
git push
2️ Jenkins Detects Change
Jenkins is connected to GitHub.
When new code is pushed, Jenkins automatically starts a job.
3️ Jenkins Builds the Project
Jenkins:
•	Pulls latest code from GitHub


•	Runs:
•	docker build -t myapp .

4  Jenkins Runs or Deploys Container

Jenkins can run:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 myapp

Now the updated app is deployed automatically.

Simple Architecture Flow

Developer → GitHub → Jenkins → Docker Build → Docker Run → Application Live

Important Jenkins Concepts Job
A task Jenkins performs (build, test, deploy).

Pipeline

A series of steps automated in order (build → test → deploy).

Plugin

Extra tools to connect Jenkins with GitHub, Docker, etc.

Jenkins Installation - (Ubuntu 24.04)
1	Install Java (Required for Jenkins)

Jenkins needs Java to run.

•	Update system (already done):
•	sudo apt update
•	sudo apt upgrade
•	Install Java 21 (Eclipse Temurin)
•	Verify:
•	java –version

2	Add Jenkins Repository & Install

•	Add Jenkins GPG key and repository
•	Update package list
•	Install Jenkins:
•	sudo apt install jenkins
•	Check status:
•	systemctl status jenkins
 
Jenkins service should be active and running. 3 Customize Jenkins Service
•	Stop Jenkins:
•	sudo systemctl stop jenkins
•	Edit service configuration:
•	sudo systemctl edit jenkins
•	Add custom JAVA_OPTS or plugin directory if needed.
•	Reload and restart Jenkins.

This allows changing:

•	Java options
•	Temp directory
•	Plugin directory

4	Fix Directory Permissions

•	Create required directories
•	Change ownership:
•	sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /path

Ensures Jenkins has proper access.

5	Start Jenkins & Check Logs

•	Start service:
•	sudo systemctl start jenkins
•	View logs:
•	journalctl -u jenkins Confirms Jenkins started successfully. 6 Web UI Setup
1.	Open browser:
2.	http://your-server-ip:8080
3.	Copy initial admin password from:
4.	/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
5.	Paste password
6.	Install suggested plugins
7.	Create admin user

Now Jenkins dashboard is ready.
 
 




Jenkins Freestyle Job – Step by Step
1 Create Job1 (Normal Freestyle Job)

1.	Open Jenkins → Click New Item
2.	Enter Job1 as name → Select Freestyle project → Click OK
3.	In Build section → Click Add build step → Execute shell
4.	Enter commands:

echo "Hello World" pwd

5.	Click Save
 
 



2  Run Job1

•	Click Build Now
•	Check Console Output
•	Hello World
•	/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job1

3  Trigger Job2 from Job1

1.	Open Job1 → Configure → Post-build Actions
2.	Select Build other projects
3.	Enter Job2 as the project to build
4.	Save


Pipeline Implementation
Instead of multiple freestyle jobs, we can use a Pipeline.

Example Pipeline Script
pipeline {
agent any stages {
stage('Clone') { steps {
git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/yourrepo.git'
}
}
stage('Build Docker Image') {
 
steps {
sh 'docker build -t webapp .'
}
}
stage('Run Container') { steps {
sh 'docker run -d -p 5000:5000 webapp'
}
}
}
}
Possible Output

•	Pipeline starts
•	Git repository cloned
•	Docker image built
•	Container started
•	Status: SUCCESS

Build Queue Workflow (Chained Jobs)
1.	Builder Job
Clones repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourrepo.git cd project-folder

2.	Image Job
Build Docker image:

docker build -t appimage .

3.	Run Job
Run container:

docker run -d -p 8050:5000 appimage

This demonstrates job chaining: Builder → Image → Run


 

 


Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline – Simple Explanation

1. Clone Code:
Jenkins pulls the latest project code from GitHub repository.

2. Build Docker Image:
Jenkins builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile inside the project.

3. Remove Old Container:
If an old version of the app is running, Jenkins stops and removes it.

4. Run New Container:
Jenkins starts a new Docker container using the newly built image.
Port Mapping: 8050 (server) → 80 (container)

5. Verify Deployment:
Jenkins checks running containers using 'docker ps'.

Final Result:
The application is live at: http://<server-ip>:8050

Whenever code is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins can automatically rebuild and redeploy the application. This is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
